# What I'm Doing
I'm revitalising a probably decade old machine by installing ProxMox, PFSense, and several other softwares on it to have 
several virtual machines serving various types of content across the school.

The server is a [ProLiant DL380 Gen9](https://techlibrary.hpe.com/us/en/mobile/iss/index.aspx?product=DL380_Gen9).

I'm using [GhostWriter](https://ghostwriter.kde.org/) to help with writing the Markdown files.
