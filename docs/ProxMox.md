# Installing Proxmox
First, I installed [Proxmox Virtual Environment](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) by burning the ISO to a DVD.

I choose to use the latest ProxMox version available, 7.3.

Proxmox VE's documentation is available [here](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/category/documentation-pve).

First thing to note: MAKE SURE both power cables are plugged in. Also, apparently a FlexibleLOM module may not be properly seated, but that could've been due to not originally having both power cables plugged in.
