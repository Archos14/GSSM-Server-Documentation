# Installing and Configuring pfSense

I started off by downloading the 2.6.0 AMD64 ISO from their [website](https://www.pfsense.org/download/).
(Even though the server runs on an Intel Xeon processor, pfSense only offers the AMD64 ISO for all 64x processors)

I followed [this](https://www.virtualizationhowto.com/2022/08/pfsense-proxmox-install-process-and-configuration/) tutorial for how to install it on a ProxMox server.
