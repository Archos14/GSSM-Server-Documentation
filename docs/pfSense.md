# Installing and Configuring pfSense

I started off by downloading the 2.6.0 AMD64 ISO from their [website](https://www.pfsense.org/download/).
(Even though the server runs on an Intel Xeon processor, pfSense only offers the AMD64 ISO for all 64x processors)

Three tutorials:

- [Second](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/recipes/virtualize-proxmox-ve.html)
